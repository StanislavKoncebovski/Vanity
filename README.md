# Vanity
*A lightweight rule-based Python library to produce lorem ipsum-like texts in languages other than Latin.*

Trying to find a tool to create non-Latin lorem ipsums I failed and decided to be creative. This is the first attempt for English (other langauges hopefully coming).
Besides this Python version, a C# port will follow (which I actually need).
